# Around the World 

Our project "Around the World", provides users with an insight into the many beautiful places found in different countries. Upon starting the program, users will be given a chance to apply their knowledge in a quiz-like scenario where they try to match a picture to one of four possible answers. After choosing one of the options, users will be shown the correct answer and be given the chance to select whether or not they'd like to travel to that location. If they choose yes, several flights to the location are presented. If they choose no, the program will simply return back to the starting screen allowing the user to discover a new part of the world that they may be willing to explore.
